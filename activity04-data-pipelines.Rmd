## Data and packages

Most of the functions that we will use this semester are from the `{tidyverse}` (which is a package of many packages - a super package).
While we will focus on `{dplyr}`, it will be nice to be able to produce graphical displays.
Therefore, instead of loading both `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}`, in the code chunk below we load all of the `{tidyverse}`.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

There is some other useful items to point out from this code chunk:

1. It has been named (i.e., `load_packages`).
  Notice that the name doesn't contain any spaces (I used `_` to separate words).
  If you put spaces in your R code chunk names, you might encounter errors later when you Knit your document.
  This is helpful because if you create a plot within a code chunk, the image will have that name!
  Another helpful thing by naming code chunks is that it helps with document navigation.
  In the upper right-hand corner of this `.Rmd` file, you can see the document outline <img src="README-img/document-outline-icon.png" alt="document outline" width = "20"/> icon.
  Clicking on this provides you with a table of contents type view.
  Another way to see this information by clicking on the "# Data and packages" at the bottom left-hand area of this `.Rmd` pane.
2. There is a code chunk option of `message = FALSE`...

### Messages

Knit your report with the `message = FALSE` R code chunk option and pay attention to how this particular code chunk and output for loading the `{tidyverse}` looks.

Now, switch this option to `message = TRUE` and knit your report again.
Discuss what is different when the `message` option is turned on (`TRUE`) and turned off (`FALSE`) for the previous code chunk.

**Response**: The list of attached packages & conflict buckets are missing. 


Turn the `message` option off and continue in this activity.

### Data

In this activity, we will explore data on college majors and earnings from the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
These data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.
If you are curious about how the raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared (not a requirement), see the FiveThirtyEight author's [code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/college-majors-rscript.R).

As we progress through this activity, remember that there are many considerations that go into picking a major.
Earning potential and employment prospects are two (important) of these considerations, but they do not tell the entire story.
Keep this in mind as we analyze the data.

These data are from an external (to R) file - a comma separated values (`.csv`) file.
We will use the `readr::read_csv` function to read in these data.
When you see something in this form, I am referring to the function as well as what package it is from (i.e., `package::function`).
We will talk more about `::` later in the course.

I try to be consistent with notation so here are some other forms that you might see in documents:

- "`{package_name}`"; for example, `{readr}`.
- "`function_name` function"; for example, `read_csv` function.
- "*hint*"; for example, *arrange* the variable.
- "**Specific Area**"; for example, **Environment** tab.

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
# Note that the :: method is redundant here
# because we have already loaded the {tidyverse}
# and {readr} is included in this.
# However, I am using this method to make you
# aware of the specific package the read_csv
# function comes from.

college_recent_grads <- readr::read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv")

college_recent_grads

# Typical style once {tidyverse} is loaded:
# college_recent_grads <- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv")
```

Notice that this dataset is in a folder called `data`.
We read it in with the `read_csv` function, then saved the results as a new data frame called `college_recent_grads`.
You can view the entire dataset by clicking on the name of the data frame in the **Environment** tab (make sure you have run both the `load_packages` and `load_data` code chunks).

Explore and describe what the `message` option does in `load_data` code chunk.

**Response**: Leaving message on allows code-generated notes to appear in the knitted file. Turning it off hides them.


Turn the `message` option off and continue in this activity.

#### Aside

Base R has a function for reading in a csv file as well.
First, knit this report and look at the output for the `load_data` code chunk.

Now, edit the reading in data code in the `load_data` code chunk to instead be:

```
college_recent_grads <- read.csv("data/recent-grads.csv")
```

Then, knit this report and look at the output for the `load_data` code chunk.
What did you notice about the output from these different functions? 
When creating a report, which function would be better to use?

Now, edit the reading in data code in the `load_data` back to what is was originally:

```
college_recent_grads <- readr::read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv")
```

If you were to load the data using `read.csv` in an `.Rmd` file and try to view it, it will print the ENTIRE dataset - this could make a short report many hundreds of pages depending on the size of your dataset.
Historically, there were some other benefits of `readr::read_csv` over `read.csv`, but these have mostly been updated to no longer be issues.
I strongly recommend that you use `readr::read_csv` instead of `read.csv`.

|`employed_full_time`           | Employed 35 hours or more
|`employed_part_time`           | Employed less than 35 hours
|`employed_full_time_yearround` | Employed at least 50 weeks (WKW == 1) and at least 35 hours (WKHP >= 35)

|`non_college_jobs`             | Number with job not requiring a college degree
|`low_wage_jobs`                | Number in low-wage service jobs

We can see that this data frame has a lot of useful information.
In the remaining sections we will answer the following questions (I'll tell you what to do, you don't need to do anything yet):

- Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?
- Which major has the highest percentage of women?
- Which STEM majors have incomes less than the median income of all majors?

Note that the ACS only asks [one question](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/sex/) about a person's sexual identity and we are therefore missing a lot of important details about individuals.

## Analysis

### Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?

#### Describe your process

What information (variables) do we need to answer this question?
Describe how you would go about answering this question using a different software (e.g., Excel, SAS, Python) that you are familiar with or simply a general process.
You do not need to code anything.
As you write this process, think of it as a series of steps and it might be helpful to start at the goal and work backwards.

**Response**: The easiest thing to do would be load the data into Google Sheets, hide everything but the major and unemployment rate columns, then sort highest to lowest. 


#### Using `{dplyr}`

In the R code chunk below, name it `rearrange_college`.

Take the `college_recent_grads` dataset, *then* `arrange` the dataset by `unemployment_rate`.

```{r rearrange_college}
arrange(college_recent_grads, unemployment_rate)
```

We have all of the information to answer our question (i.e., "Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?"), but it is not in an effective format.
The major names barely fit on the page, we have many variables are not that useful in answering our question (e.g., `major_code`, `major_category`), and some variables that we might want front-and-center are not easily viewed (i.e., `unemployment_rate`).
Also, notice that by default when you *arrange* by a variable, it defaults to *ascending* order.

#### Removing unnecessary information

Use the pipeline that you made in the `rearrange_college` code chunk as the start to this solution, **then** `select` only the variables `rank`, `major`, and `unemployment_rate`.
Name this code chunk `lowest_unemploy`.

```{r lowest_unemploy}
college_recent_grads %>% 
  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate) %>% 
  arrange(unemployment_rate)
```

**Response**: I was surprised to see nuclear engineering followed by public admin. It doesn't make sense to me at all, especially in 2012.


<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your project. The remainder of this activity will help to expand these commands.

### Which major has the highest proportion of women?

Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, `arrange` the dataset by `sharewomen`, and `select` only `rank`, `major`, and `sharewomen`. 
Name your code chunk `highest_prop_women`.

```{r highest_prop_women}
college_recent_grads %>% 
  select(rank, major, sharewomen) %>% 
  arrange(sharewomen)
```

Discuss your output as it relates to the research question.

**Response**: Zero surprises in this table, except that I didn't know that Military Technologies was a major.


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Which STEM majors have incomes less than the median income of all majors?

One of the sections of the FiveThirtyEight story is "All STEM fields aren't the same".
We will see if this is true.

Below is a new vector called `stem_categories` that lists the *major categories* (this is not the `majors` variable - look back at the Data Codebook) that are considered STEM fields.

```{r stem_categories}
stem_categories <- c("Biology & Life Science",
                     "Computers & Mathematics",
                     "Engineering",
                     "Physical Sciences")
```

In our next activity we will see how to calculate summary statistics, but for now believe me that the median salary for all majors is $36,000.

Using the `stem_categories` vector and knowledge that the median salary for all majors is $36,000 to *keep* the rows in the `college_recent_grads` data set that are in the STEM fields and earn *less* than the `median` salary of all majors.
Only display the variables `major`, `p25th`, `median`, and `p75th`
Name the code chunk `stem_low_salaries`.

```{r stem_low_salaries}
stem_categories <- c("Biology & Life Science",
                     "Computers & Mathematics",
                     "Engineering",
                     "Physical Sciences")
college_recent_grads %>% 
  filter(median < 36000, major_category == stem_categories) %>% 
  select(major, p25th, median, p75th)
```

Discuss your output as it relates to the research question.

**Response**: Env. Science, Comm. Technologies, Neuroscience, Ecology, and Zoology have income lower than the median. 

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **(Final) Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity04-data-pieplines.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
